Poker Equity Calculator

Basic poker equity calculator that takes the user's number of outs and the chance they believe their opponent will fold and provides the natural, fold, and total, equity. Includes a basic random number generator that will take folding, calling, betting, and raising, frequencies and generate an action to take. (RNG is still under construction)
